# IMAGE-PROCESSING 
The project its about how to load images, convert them into Numpy arrays, explore their shapes, pixel values, and manipulate the image colors using libraries like Numpy, Opencv and Matplotlib.

# Tools and Libraries
Python: Programming language used.
NumPy: To handle and manipulate image data as arrays.
Matplotlib: To visualize the images and plots.
OpenCV: Used for computer vision, image processing, and video analysis.
PIL (Pillow): For image handling (if used).

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic image processing techniques

Uploading and loading image into Python
Converting the image into Numpy array for manipulation
Understanding the shape and pixel values of the image
Modifyimg specific color channels of the image to apply effects
Displaying the image after changes using Matplotlib
